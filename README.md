# ThreeJs-basics
In this repo you can find a short demo project of ThreeJs, with good documented code. It is for people who are new to javaScript and want to learn the
absolut basics of ThreeJs

## For those who dont know what ThreeJs is:
ThreeJs is a library of functions to create a web renderd 3D enviroment. It has a few standard geometries and materials for objects, but can be
easly expanded with 3D models from the Internet or even Blender.

## To set it up

**Install threeJs**

First you have to install threeJs. This can be done with the command
> npm install three

If this doesn't work, try it as supersuser like this
> sudo npm install three

**Install dat gui**

Not needed, but used in that demo and definitely recommended, is dat gui. This library which allows you to easly create gui's for easyer debuging and tweaking.
You can install it with
> npm install dat.gui

**Install parcel**

Parcel gives you the freedom to see live in the browser what you are doing. You can install parcel in you project, or global
For one project
> npm install --save-dev parcel

global
> npm install parcel -g

Again, if issues try it as super user with the prefix:
> sudo

To start the parcel server you need this command with the path of you html (in this case ./src/index.html)
> parcel ./src/index.html  


I hope this short demo, and the comments, help you get into ThreeJs and have fun with it. For furter details I recommend checking the 
very usefull docu of ThreeJs.
